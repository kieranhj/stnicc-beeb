TECHNICAL SUPPORT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Requires 16K SWRAM in any slot to
play music. Press Q during the intro
to toggle sound on / off.

When playing on real hardware only
actual floppy disc drives or Gotek
devices will work correctly.

RAMFS (DataCentre) and MMC/MMFS
devices are known to cause audio and
slowdown issues due to incompatible
interrupt behaviour.

Video NuLA colour board now supported!
This will be autodetected at boot to
give 12-bit colour, same as the Atari
STe demo, albeit at lower resolution.
Press N during the intro to toggle
between NuLA and original graphics.

For best emulation of Video NuLA
use the b2 emulator found here:
